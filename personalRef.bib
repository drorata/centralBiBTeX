	Abstract = {Previous approaches to trajectory generation for rigid bodies have been either based on the so-called invariant screw motions or on ad hoc decompositions into rotations and translations. This paper formulates the trajectory generation problem in the framework of Lie groups and Riemannian geometry. The goal is to determine optimal curves joining given points with appropriate boundary conditions on the Euclidean group. Since this results in a two-point boundary value problem that has to be solved iteratively, a computationally efficient, analytical method that generates near-optimal trajectories is derived. The method consists of two steps. The first step involves generating the optimal trajectory in an ambient space, while the second step is used to project this trajectory onto the Euclidean group. The paper describes the method, its applications and its performance in terms of optimality and efficiency.},

	Abstract = {{Let S be a smooth surface of E^3, p a point on S, k\_m, k\_M, k\_G and k\_H the maximum, minimum, Gauss and mean curvatures of S at p. Consider a set {p\_ipp\_(i+1)} i=1,...,n of n Euclidean triangles forming a piecewise linear approximation of S around p ---with p\_(n+1)=p\_1. For each triangle, let [gamma]\_i be the angle /\_ p\_ipp\_(i+1), and let the angular defect at p be 2[pi]-[SIGMA]\_i[gamma- ]\_i. This paper establishes, when the distances || pp\_i || go to zero, that the angular defect is asymptotically equivalent to a homogeneous polynomial of degree two in the principal curvatures. For regular meshes, we provide closed forms expressions for the three coefficients of this polynomial. We show that vertices of valence four and six are the only ones where k\_G can be inferred from the angular defect. At other vertices, we show that the principal curvatures can be derived from the angular defects of two independent triangulations. For irregular meshes, we show that the angular defect weighted by the so-called module of the mesh estimates k\_G within an error bound depending upon k\_m and k\_M. Since meshes are so ubiquitous in Computer Graphics and Computer Aided Design, and Discrete Differential operators are so necessary to their processing, we believe these contributions are one step forward the intelligence of the geometry of meshes, whence one step forward more robust algorithms.}},

	Abstract = {{G}iven a smooth surface, a blue (red) ridge is a curve such that at each of its points, the maximum (minimum) principal curvature has an extremum along its curvature line. {R}idges are curves of {\em extremal} curvature and therefore encode important informations used in segmentation, registration, matching and surface analysis. {S}tate of the art methods for ridge extraction either report red and blue ridges simultaneously or separately ---in which case a local orientation procedure of principal directions is needed, but no method developed so far certifies the topology of the curves reported. \medskip {O}n the way to developing certified algorithms independent from local orientation procedures, we make the following fundamental contributions. {F}or any smooth parametric surface, we exhibit the implicit equation ${P}=0$ of the singular curve $\cal{P}$ encoding all ridges and umbilics of the surface (blue and red), and show how to recover the colors from factors of ${P}$. {E}xploiting second order derivatives of the principal curvatures, we also derive a zero dimensional system coding the so-called turning points, from which elliptic and hyperbolic ridge sections of the two colors can be derived. {B}oth contributions exploit properties of the {W}eingarten map of the surface in the specific parametric setting and require computer algebra. {A}lgorithms exploiting the structure of ${P}$ for algebraic surfaces are developed in a companion paper.},

	Abstract = {Using Fast Marching for the incremental computation of distance maps
	across the sampling domain, we obtain an efficient farthest point
	sampling technique (FastFPS). The method is based on that of Eldar
	et al. [6, 7] but extends more naturally to the case of non-uniform
	sampling and is more widely applicable. Furthermore, it can be applied
	to both planar domains and curved manifolds and allows for weighted
	domains in which different cost is associated with different points
	on the surface. We conclude with considering the extension of FastFPS
	to the sampling of point clouds without the need for prior surface
	reconstruction.},

@techreport{Ch10,
	Abstract = {{D}ata often comes in the form of a point cloud sampled from an unknown
	compact subset of {E}uclidean space. {T}he general goal of geometric
	inference is then to recover geometric and topological features ({B}etti
	numbers, curvatures,...) of this subset from the approximating point
	cloud data. {I}n recent years, it appeared that the study of distance
	functions allows to address many of these questions successfully.
	{H}owever, one of the main limitations of this framework is that
	it does not cope well with outliers nor with background noise. {I}n
	this paper, we show how to extend the framework of distance functions
	to overcome this problem. {R}eplacing compact subsets by measures,
	we introduce a notion of distance function to a probability distribution
	in $R^n$. {T}hese functions share many properties with classical
	distance functions, which makes them suitable for inference purposes.
	{I}n particular, by considering appropriate level sets of these distance
	functions, it is possible to associate in a robust way topological
	and geometric features to a probability measure. {W}e also discuss
	connections between our approach and non parametric density estimation
	as well as mean-shift clustering.},

	verbose 3{D} datasets be reduced to more concise, yet faithful representations.
	{D}espite numerous applications ranging from geometry compression
	to reverse engineering, concisely capturing the geometry of a surface
	remains a tedious task. {I}n this paper, we present both theoretical
	and practical contributions that result in a novel and versatile
	framework for geometric approximation of surfaces. {W}e depart from
	the usual strategy by casting shape approximation as a variational
	geometric partitioning problem. {U}sing the concept of geometric
	proxies, we drive the distortion error down through repeated clustering
	of faces into best-fitting regions. {O}ur approach is entirely discrete
	and error-driven, and does not require parameterization or local
	estimations of differential quantities. {W}e also introduce a new
	metric based on normal deviation, and demonstrate its superior behavior
	at capturing anisotropy.},

	Abstract = {A technique is presented for obtaining bounds for a polynomial function of one variable. Consider an nth order polynomial function g(x), defined over the interval a<sub>0</sub> ≤ x ≤ a<sub>n + 1</sub> and having unknown coefficients z<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>2</sub>, ⋯, z<sub>n</sub>. Suppose that upper and lower bounds for g(x) are known at the points x = a<sub>i</sub>, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, where <latex>$a_0 \leqq a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n \leqq a_{n+1}$</latex>. Then upper and lower bounds can be obtained for the entire function g over the interval a<sub>0</sub> ≤ x ≤ a<sub>n + 1</sub>. The upper and lower bounds for g are found to be piecewise-polynomials which pass through appropriate points selected from among the upper and lower bounds at the points a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ⋯, a<sub>n</sub>.},

abstract ={Given a set of data points in R2 and corresponding data values, it is clear that the quality of a piecewise linear interpolation over triangles depends on the specific triangulation of the data points. While conventional triangulation methods depend only on the distribution of the data points in R2 in this paper we suggest that the triangulation should depend on the data values as well. Several data dependent criteria for defining the triangulation are discussed and efficient algorithms for computing these triangulations are presented. It is shown for a variety of test cases that data dependent triangulations can improve significantly the quality of approximation and that long and thin triangles, which are traditionally avoided, are sometimes very suitable.},

	Abstract = {We develop a method for measuring and localizing homology classes.
	This involves two problems. First, we define relevant notions of
	size for both a homology class and a homology group basis, using
	ideas from relative homology. Second, we propose an algorithm to
	compute the optimal homology basis, using techniques from persistent
	homology and finite field algebra. Classes of the computed optimal
	basis are localized with cycles conveying their sizes. The algorithm
	runs in $O(\beta^4 n^3 \log^2 n)$ time, where $n$ is the size of
	the simplicial complex and $\beta$ is the Betti number of the homology
	group.},

	graduate mathematics courses is algebraic topology. This introductory
	text is suitable for use in a course on the subject or for self-study,
	featuring broad coverage and a readable exposition, with many examples
	and exercises. The four main chapters present the basics: fundamental
	group and covering spaces, homology and cohomology, higher homotopy
	groups, and homotopy theory generally. The author emphasizes the
	geometric aspects of the subject, which helps students gain intuition.
	A unique feature is the inclusion of many optional topics not usually
	part of a first course due to time constraints: Bockstein and transfer
	homomorphisms, direct and inverse limits, H-spaces and Hopf algebras,
	the Brown representability theorem, the James reduced product, the
	Dold-Thom theorem, and Steenrod squares and powers.}},

	Abstract = {We provide an analysis of a path planning method which uses probabilistic roadmaps. This method has proven very successful in practice, but the theoretical understanding of its performance is still limited. Assuming that a path γ exists between two configurations a and b of the robot, we study the dependence of the failure probability to connect a and b, on: 1) the length of γ; 2) the distance function of γ from the obstacles; 3) the number of nodes N of the probabilistic roadmap constructed. Importantly, our results do not depend strongly on local irregularities of the configuration space, as was the case with previous analysis. These results are illustrated with a simple but illuminating example. In this example, we provide estimates for N, the principal parameter of the method, in order to achieve failure probability within prescribed bounds. We also compare, through this example, the different approaches to the analysis of the planning method.},

	Abstract = {We present a new definition of an implicit surface over a noisy point
	cloud, based on the weighted least squares approach. It can be evaluated
	very fast, but artifacts are significantly reduced. We propose to
	use a different kernel function that approximates geodesic distances
	on the surface by utilizing a geometric proximity graph. From a variety
	of possibilities, we have examined the Delaunay graph and the sphere-of-influence
	graph (SIG), for which we propose several extensions. The proximity
	graph also allows us to estimate the local sampling density, which
	we utilize to automatically adapt the bandwidth of the kernel and
	to detect boundaries. Consequently, our method is able to handle
	point clouds of varying sampling density without manual tuning. Our
	method can be integrated into other surface definitions, such as
	moving least squares, so that these benefits carry over.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a new algorithm for computing Euclidean shortest paths
	in the plane in the presence of polygonal obstacles. In particular,
	for a given start points, we build a planar subdivision (ashortest
	path map) that supports efficient queries for shortest paths froms
	to any destination pointt. The worst-case time complexity of our
	algorithm isO(kn log2 n), wheren is the number of vertices describing
	the polygonal obstacles, andk is a parameter we call the ldquoillumination
	depthrdquo of the obstacle space. Our algorithm usesO(n) space, avoiding
	the possibly quadratic space complexity of methods that rely on visibility
	graphs. The quantityk is frequently significantly smaller thann,
	especially in some of the cases in which the visibility graph has
	quadratic size. In particular,k is bounded above by the number of
	different obstacles that touch any shortest path froms.},

	Abstract = {We study piecewise linear approximation of
                  quadratic functions defined on Rn. Invariance
                  properties and canonical Caley/Klein metrics that
                  help in understanding this problem can be handled in
                  arbitrary dimensions. However, the problem of
                  optimal approximants in the sense that their linear
                  pieces are of maximal size by keeping a given error
                  tolerance, is a difficult one. We present a detailed
                  discussion of the case n=2, where we can partially
                  use results from convex geometry and discrete
                  geomerty. The case n=3 is considerably harder, and
                  thus just a few results can be formulated so far.},

	image may be written as a first-order nonlinear equation which presents
	the disadvantage of having several continuous and even smooth solutions.
	A new approach based on Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations and viscosity
	solutions theories enables one to study non-uniqueness phenomenon
	and thus to characterize the surface among the various solutions.
	A consistent and monotone scheme approximating the surface is constructed
	thanks to the dynamic programming principle, and numerical results
	are presented.},

	Abstract = {The computation of geodesic paths and distances on triangle meshes
	is a common operation in many computer graphics applications. We
	present several practical algorithms for computing such geodesics
	from a source point to one or all other points efficiently. First,
	we describe an implementation of the exact "single source, all destination"
	algorithm presented by Mitchell, Mount, and Papadimitriou (MMP).
	We show that the algorithm runs much faster in practice than suggested
	by worst case analysis. Next, we extend the algorithm with a merging
	operation to obtain computationally efficient and accurate approximations
	with bounded error. Finally, to compute the shortest path between
	two given points, we use a lower-bound property of our approximate
	geodesic algorithm to efficiently prune the frontier of the MMP algorithm.
	thereby obtaining an exact solution even more quickly.},

@article{Th12,
	Abstract = { <p>In this paper, we present a novel method for computing multiple geodesic connections between two arbitrary points on a smooth surface. Our method is based on a homotopy approach that is able to capture the ambiguity of geodesic connections in the presence of positive Gaussian curvature that generates focal curves.
Contrary to previous approaches, we exploit focal curves to gain theoretical insights on the number of connecting geodesics and a practical algorithm for collecting these.
We consider our method as a contribution to the contemporary debate regarding the calculation of distances in general situations, applying continuous concepts of classical differential geometry which are not immediately transferable in purely discrete settings.</p> },

	Abstract = {We show that the traditional criterion for a simplex to belong to
	the Delaunay triangulation of a point set is equivalent to a criterion
	which is a priori weaker. The argument is quite general; as well
	as the classical Euclidean case, it applies to hyperbolic and hemispherical
	geometries and to Edelsbrunner's weighted Delaunay triangulation.
	In spherical geometry, we establish a similar theorem under a genericity
	condition. The weak definition finds natural application in the problem
	of approximating a point-cloud data set with a simplical complex.},
